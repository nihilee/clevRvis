        techniques for clonal evolution. These include shark plots, dolphin
	plots and plaice plots. Algorithms for time point interpolation 
	as well as therapy effect estimation are provided. Phylogeny-aware
	color coding is implemented. A shiny-app for generating plots
	interactively is additionally provided.
